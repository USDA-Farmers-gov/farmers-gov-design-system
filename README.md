### Working with precompiled assets

_In order to use our Gulp tasks to compile the Sass and ES6+ JavaScript files, you'll need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) installed on your machine._

+ To download this repository, the following commands can be used in the terminal.  
  `$ git clone git@github.com:USDA-Farmers-gov/Farmers.Gov-Design-System.git`  
then run `$ cd Farmers.Gov-Design-System` to navigate into the repository directory.

+ Once you have the repository downloaded, make sure you are in the repository directory and run `npm install` to get all of the necessary packages.

+ After all of the packages have been installed, you can run the Gulp tasks to generate the compiled JavaScript and CSS files.

##### Gulp Tasks   
_These gulp tasks put the compiled assets in the `/dist` directory._
